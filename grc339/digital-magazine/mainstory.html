                    <h2>Tsunoda in the Spotlight</h2>        <!-- Heading as h2 -->
                    
                    <p>Yuki Tsunoda's promotion to Red Bull Racing in 2025 marked a significant milestone in his Formula 1 career. After impressing with Racing Bulls, Tsunoda replaced Liam Lawson at Red Bull ahead of the Japanese Grand Prix. This move was particularly poignant, as it coincided with the final year of Red Bull's partnership with Honda, making his debut at Suzuka—a track integral to his racing roots—even more special.</p>
                    <p>Tsunoda's transition to the RB21 car presented challenges. He acknowledged that adapting to the car's unique characteristics required time and effort, stating that he didn't fully understand how to extract maximum performance from it . To support his adaptation, Red Bull adjusted the car's setup to be more predictable, aiming to build his confidence and avoid issues similar to those experienced by his predecessor.</p>

                    </figure>  
                    <p>Despite these hurdles, Tsunoda demonstrated resilience and potential. In Bahrain, he secured his first points for Red Bull with a ninth-place finish, showcasing his ability to manage tire wear and navigate race challenges . However, not all races were smooth; a first-lap collision in Saudi Arabia highlighted the ongoing learning curve he faced with his new team.</p>
                    <p>A notable incident occurred during qualifying at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, where Tsunoda suffered a dramatic crash, flipping his car after hitting the barriers. Fortunately, he emerged unscathed and was cleared by medical staff. The crash, which he termed a "stupid mistake," underscored the fine margins in Formula 1 and the challenges of adapting to a new car under pressure.</p>

                    <p>Overall, Tsunoda's journey with Red Bull Racing in 2025 reflects both the promise and challenges of ascending to a top-tier Formula 1 team. His performances have shown glimpses of his potential, and with continued support and development, he aims to solidify his position and contribute significantly to the team's success in the championship.</p>
